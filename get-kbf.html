      <h2>KabanFactoryBand (KBF) Token Acquisition Request</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the KabanFactoryBand (KBF) experimental DeFi project! KBF tokens are offered as unique "meme souvenirs" inspired by the legendary Kaban Kabanich. These tokens allow you to engage in various activities: collecting digital mementos, using them freely for your personal purposes, or testing blockchain and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) mechanisms on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
      </p>
      <p>
        Important Disclaimer: KBF is an experimental token, a symbolic collectible, and NOT an investment. It has no intrinsic monetary value, and its acquisition does not guarantee any future profit or return of funds. It's designed for fun, experimentation, and as a unique digital keepsake related to the meme. Its nature is akin to a collectible card or an NFT, not a security or financial instrument. By acquiring KBF, you are supporting the project's development.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure efficient distribution, please complete all sections of this form accurately after sending your USDT contribution. KBF tokens are acquired by contributing USDT (BEP-20) at a fixed price of $0.30 USD per KBF token. Please note that only whole KBF tokens can be acquired (no fractional tokens). This contribution directly supports the KabanFactoryBand project's development as a unique digital souvenir of the Kaban Kabanich meme.

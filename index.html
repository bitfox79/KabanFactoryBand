      <h2>About KabanFactoryBand: The Meme & The Token</h2>
      <p>
        KabanFactoryBand (KBF) is the name of an in-game meme and its associated community that originated on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Multiplayer (SAMP) servers. The KBF movement represents a socio-cultural phenomenon that formed as a reaction to certain aspects of role-playing (RP) and became a distinctive counterculture within SAMP. It is closely associated with the key meme character – Kaban Kabanich.
      </p>

      <h3>Origin: From Factory Routines to Exploit Discovery</h3>
      <p>
        The KabanFactoryBand (KBF) movement began at one of SAMP's production locations, presumably a factory. It was here, amidst routine workdays, that the nickname Kaban Kabanich emerged and solidified for the leader of the future movement. A core group of initial participants, united by shared views on the game, formed around him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, this community functioned as a Post-RP association – a space for players who had finished their active role-playing session but remained on the server for informal communication and discussion. However, a turning point came when Kaban Kabanich and his like-minded companions discovered a systemic flaw (exploit) in SAMP's in-game business economy. By exploiting this vulnerability, they were able to obtain significant amounts of virtual currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        This discovery was a revelation. The band members realized they were far more interested in the very concept of earning and various ways to achieve it, especially through unconventional paths, rather than role-play itself. This interest extended beyond mere in-game currency, sparking a desire in them to seek similar opportunities everywhere.
      </p>

      <h3>Ideology: Aversion to "Schizo-RP" and Preference for "Real" Endeavors</h3>
      <p>
        A key factor that catalyzed the emergence of a full-fledged movement was Kaban Kabanich's and his comrades' deep dissatisfaction with the essence of what they called "Schizo-RP." The term "Schizo-RP" was coined by them to denote role-playing characterized by chaos, illogicality, meaninglessness, and a general sense of "madness" within the context of the game. This was not merely a "type" of role-play, but its very internal, irrational nature, which contradicted their perception of common sense and game immersion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of wasting time on "Schizo-RP," KabanFactoryBand began to prefer real endeavors – that is, actions aimed at gaining concrete benefits or achieving tangible results. It was at this stage, with the emergence of an interest in universal earning strategies, that the movement based on cryptocurrency (a meme token) began to take root, becoming a logical continuation of their interest in finding value in the virtual world.
      </p>

      <h3>Symbolism and Interests</h3>
      <p>
        In contrast to the, in their opinion, destructive nature of "Schizo-RP," the KabanFactoryBand movement developed its own, utterly simple and down-to-earth symbolism, reflecting their values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pasta: Symbolizes simplicity, clarity, and basic needs, contrasting with the complexity and absurdity of "Schizo-RP." Furthermore, the KBF cryptocurrency itself is metaphorically tied to the value of pasta, emphasizing its "folk" character, understandability, and reference to fundamental, real values, unlike speculative and at times meaningless "Schizo-RP."</li>
        <li>Cryptocurrency (as the main interest and the name of the KBF movement): Reflects their pursuit of stability, progress, and concrete gain in a new, digital format, contrasting with the chaotic and unpredictable "Schizo-RP" environment, and also as a continuation of their universal interest in earning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These elements became a kind of manifesto, emphasizing that Kaban Kabanich does not accept "Schizo-RP," preferring cryptocurrency (pegged to pasta) and pasta itself. Thus, KabanFactoryBand (KBF) became an expression of the desire for order, logic, and tangible values in the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable world of SAMP. It highlights the conflict between players' desire for deep and meaningful interaction and common manifestations of low-quality or absurd role-playing.
      </p>

      <h2>Tokenomics & Technical Features</h2>
      <p>
        The KabanFactoryBand (KBF) token is designed primarily as a unique meme souvenir and digital collectible. It can also serve as an experimental tool for DeFi mechanism testing, rather than a traditional cryptocurrency with inherent economic value. Its structure allows for flexible supply management essential for community engagement and research, reflecting its meme-inspired, non-investment nature.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Token Standard: BEP-20 (fully compatible with ERC-20 functionality).</li>
        <li>Total Initial Supply: 100,000,000 KBF.</li>
        <li>Decimals: 18.</li>
        <li>Max Supply: Unlimited. The token is designed with controlled minting capabilities managed by the MINTER_ROLE. This allows the founder to issue new tokens as needed for continuous testing, research distribution, and acquisition by the community as unique meme souvenirs. This flexible supply mechanism is crucial for an experimental token that does not aim for fixed market capitalization.</li>
        <li>Current Distribution: As a meme souvenir and experimental token, KBF is acquired by contributing USDT (BEP-20) at a fixed price of $0.30 USD per KBF token. The current supply is managed by the founder for direct distribution to those who acquire it, ensuring immediate availability for participants interested in collecting or testing DeFi protocols.</li>
        <li>Non-Economic Value: It is crucial to understand that KBF tokens hold no intrinsic monetary value and are NOT an investment, security, or financial instrument. Their purpose is purely for collecting a unique digital keepsake, for personal use, or for participation in the KabanFactoryBand experimental ecosystem and testing DeFi functionalities. By acquiring KBF, you are supporting the project's development as a unique digital souvenir of the Kaban Kabanich meme.</li>
        <li>Voluntary Burning: KBF supports voluntary token burning, allowing any token holder to permanently remove tokens from circulation. This mechanism can be utilized for specific testing scenarios or community-driven initiatives to adjust the circulating supply.</li>
        <li>Pausable Transfers: The token features a pausable function, enabling authorized roles to temporarily halt transfers. This is a safeguard for managing the experimental environment, with any such actions being communicated transparently via our social channels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The design of KBF emphasizes its role as a versatile tool for blockchain and DeFi experimentation, and primarily as a collectible meme souvenir, rather than a speculative asset. Its features allow for robust testing of various protocol interactions without the constraints of market valuation.

      <h2>Live KBF Price (Pasta-pegged Fixed Value)</h2>
      <p>
        In the spirit of Kaban Kabanich's love for pasta, the KBF token's "value" is metaphorically tied to the price of this fundamental staple. While KBF has no real economic value and serves primarily as a meme souvenir, its price is fixed based on a playful calculation:
      </p>
      <p>
        Using average retail pasta prices in Western Europe (€2.577 per kg) and defining 1 KBF as equivalent to 100g of pasta (0.1 kg), the foundational "pasta value" for 1 KBF is approximately €0.2577. Converting this to USD using an average EUR/USD rate of 1.1009 results in ~ $0.2837.
      </p>
      <p>
        For simplicity and ease of understanding, the price of 1 KBF has been rounded and fixed at $0.30 USD.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center; padding: 1rem;">
        <div id="kbf-price" style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">$0.300000</div>
        <div id="kbf-updated" style="font-size: .9rem; color: #666; margin-top: .2rem;"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This fixed price is for experimental purposes only and does not reflect any market valuation or investment opportunity for KBF tokens. KBF is primarily a meme souvenir and a tool for community-driven DeFi experimentation.
